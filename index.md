### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3 was a favorite of mine because it was the first lab where we had to actually figure out what to do and use what we learned from our readings and lecture. This lab allowed us to practice the basics of C++, like using cin and cout. From this lab, I realized that coding is easier if I do the readings and learn more about the language. I also learned that my notes are an important resource.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite of mine because I was able to fully understand what loops did with this lab. In the previous lab, loops were also used, but I didn't really understand them. Making the pattern with the dashes and bars allowed me to see how the loops worked. The lab also helped me understand how loops within loops and the counting within those loops work.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was a favorite of mine because I learned how to read from files, write to files, and even played an animation. This lab also showed my growth in coding since I knew what to do whenever the TODO comments asked for argument inputs and error messages. In the early labs, I was clueless and would struggle for a bit. I liked these labs in that they involved more than just the main.cc files. Playing the animation in part 3 was also pretty cool and showed me the possible things you can do with coding.
